## Installation
- Install [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=requirements) for Schedule I
- Put the NastyApp.dll inside the Mods folder in the games root directory (if it does not exist, start the game once and close it before putting the .dll inside the directory) - the path for example would be C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I
- Start the game and toggle the different interfaces with their respective hotkeys.
